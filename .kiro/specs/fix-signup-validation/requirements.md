# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes the signup validation error where users receive "ensure email format is correct and password must meet security requirements VALIDATION_ERROR" during registration. The issue occurs because the Zod validation middleware still enforces strong password requirements even though the AuthUtils password validation has been disabled to allow weak passwords.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user trying to sign up, I want to be able to register with any password strength, so that I can create an account without being blocked by password complexity requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a registration form with a weak password THEN the system SHALL accept the password and proceed with registration
2. WHEN a user enters a password shorter than 8 characters THEN the system SHALL not show password length validation errors
3. WHEN a user enters a password without uppercase letters THEN the system SHALL not show uppercase letter requirement errors
4. WHEN a user enters a password without lowercase letters THEN the system SHALL not show lowercase letter requirement errors
5. WHEN a user enters a password without numbers THEN the system SHALL not show number requirement errors
6. WHEN a user enters a password without special characters THEN the system SHALL not show special character requirement errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user trying to sign up, I want clear and accurate email validation, so that I can understand if my email format is incorrect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid email format THEN the system SHALL accept the email and proceed with validation
2. WHEN a user enters an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message about email format
3. WHEN a user enters an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL display a specific message about email already being registered
4. WHEN email validation passes THEN the system SHALL not display email format errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the validation middleware to be consistent with the disabled password validation policy, so that the system behaves predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AuthUtils.validatePasswordStrength method allows weak passwords THEN the Zod validation schema SHALL also allow weak passwords
2. WHEN password validation is disabled in one part of the system THEN it SHALL be disabled consistently across all validation layers
3. WHEN users register with weak passwords THEN the system SHALL hash and store them securely regardless of strength
4. WHEN validation schemas are updated THEN existing functionality SHALL remain intact for other fields

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the registration process to work smoothly without conflicting validation rules, so that I can successfully create an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create the account successfully
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN they SHALL be specific and actionable
3. WHEN password validation is bypassed THEN other security measures SHALL remain intact (hashing, JWT tokens, etc.)
4. WHEN registration succeeds THEN the user SHALL receive appropriate tokens and be logged in
