# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Update password validation schema in validation middleware



  - Modify the `commonSchemas.password` in `backend/src/middleware/validation.ts` to use simple validation
  - Change from complex regex requirements to basic `z.string().min(1, "Password is required")`
  - Add comment explaining that password complexity validation is disabled
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 3.1, 3.2_



- [ ] 2. Update change password schema validation

  - Modify the `authSchemas.changePassword` newPassword field in `backend/src/middleware/validation.ts`
  - Replace `commonSchemas.password` with simplified password validation


  - Ensure currentPassword validation remains as basic string requirement
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Test registration flow with weak passwords

  - Create integration test for user registration using various weak passwords


  - Test registration with passwords like "123", "a", "password", "test"
  - Verify that registration completes successfully and returns proper tokens
  - Confirm that passwords are still properly hashed with bcrypt
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Test email validation accuracy



  - Create tests for email validation with valid and invalid email formats
  - Test that valid emails pass validation without errors
  - Test that invalid emails show specific email format error messages
  - Verify that duplicate email registration shows appropriate error
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 4.2_




- [ ] 5. Verify validation consistency across system

  - Test that both Zod validation and AuthUtils validation allow weak passwords
  - Create test to verify password validation is consistently disabled
  - Test that other validation rules (email, phone, role) remain strict
  - Confirm that security measures (hashing, JWT) work with weak passwords
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 4.3_

- [ ] 6. Test complete authentication flow
  - Create end-to-end test for registration and login with weak passwords
  - Test that users can register with weak password and immediately log in
  - Verify that JWT tokens are generated correctly for weak password users
  - Test that session management works properly with simplified validation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
