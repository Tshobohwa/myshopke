# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Locate and analyze current navbar implementation



  - Find the navbar component file (likely `src/components/Navbar.tsx`, `src/components/Header.tsx`, or similar)
  - Identify the logo element and its current styling
  - Document existing CSS classes, dimensions, and responsive behavior
  - Note the logo asset file location and format (SVG, PNG, etc.)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3_


- [x] 2. Implement logo size increase using CSS transform



  - [ ] 2.1 Apply transform scale to logo element

    - Add `transform: scale(1.3)` CSS property to the logo
    - Set appropriate `transform-origin` to control scaling anchor point


    - Ensure the transform doesn't affect layout of surrounding elements
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_


  - [ ] 2.2 Adjust navbar container for larger logo
    - Modify navbar height or padding to accommodate the enlarged logo
    - Ensure proper vertical alignment of all navbar elements


    - Test that the navbar maintains its visual balance
    - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1_

- [ ] 3. Implement responsive design adjustments



  - [ ] 3.1 Test and adjust mobile viewport behavior


    - Verify logo scaling works properly on mobile devices (< 768px)
    - Adjust scale factor if needed to prevent horizontal overflow
    - Ensure touch target remains appropriate size for mobile interaction
    - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2, 3.4_



  - [ ] 3.2 Optimize tablet and desktop display
    - Test logo scaling on tablet devices (768px - 1024px)
    - Verify desktop display (> 1024px) maintains proper proportions
    - Ensure logo alignment with other navbar elements across all screen sizes


    - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2, 3.2_


- [ ] 4. Maintain navbar functionality and interactions

  - [ ] 4.1 Verify logo click behavior



    - Test that logo click/tap functionality continues to work after resize
    - Ensure any navigation or routing behavior remains intact
    - Verify hover effects (if any) still work properly
    - _Requirements: 2.4_



  - [x] 4.2 Test navbar element spacing and alignment

    - Ensure other navbar items (menu links, buttons) remain properly positioned
    - Verify adequate spacing between logo and adjacent elements
    - Test navbar collapse behavior on mobile if applicable
    - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Cross-browser and accessibility testing



  - [ ] 5.1 Test across major browsers

    - Verify logo scaling works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
    - Test on both desktop and mobile versions of browsers



    - Document any browser-specific issues and implement fixes
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

  - [ ] 5.2 Verify accessibility compliance
    - Ensure logo alt text remains properly associated
    - Test keyboard navigation and focus behavior


    - Verify screen reader compatibility with resized logo
    - Check color contrast if logo overlays any background elements
    - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [ ] 6. Performance and quality assurance


  - [ ] 6.1 Measure performance impact

    - Test page load times before and after logo resize
    - Verify no layout shift (CLS) issues are introduced
    - Ensure smooth rendering across different device capabilities
    - _Requirements: 1.2_

  - [ ] 6.2 Visual quality verification
    - Confirm logo maintains crisp appearance at 1.3x scale
    - Test image quality on high-DPI displays (Retina, etc.)
    - Verify no pixelation or blurriness occurs
    - Document any asset optimization needs
    - _Requirements: 1.2_

- [ ] 7. Create fallback implementation if needed

  - Implement alternative sizing method (width/height) as fallback for older browsers
  - Add progressive enhancement for browsers that don't support CSS transforms
  - Test fallback behavior and ensure consistent visual result
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 8. Final integration testing
  - Test the complete navbar with enlarged logo in the full application context
  - Verify integration with any existing navbar animations or transitions
  - Ensure no conflicts with other UI components or layouts
  - Perform user acceptance testing to confirm visual improvement
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4_
