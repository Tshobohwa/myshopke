# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on making the MyShopKE backend application deployable on Vercel's serverless platform. The backend is currently a Node.js/Express application with TypeScript, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL database that needs to be adapted for Vercel's serverless environment while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the backend API to Vercel, so that I can leverage Vercel's serverless infrastructure for better scalability and easier deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed to Vercel THEN the application SHALL run as serverless functions
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL respond correctly with the same functionality as the current Express server
3. WHEN the application starts THEN Prisma client SHALL be properly initialized in the serverless environment
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL work correctly with the PostgreSQL database

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Vercel configuration files, so that the deployment process is automated and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN a vercel.json configuration file SHALL define the proper routing and build settings
2. WHEN building the application THEN Vercel SHALL use the correct Node.js version and build commands
3. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN they SHALL be properly configured for the Vercel environment
4. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL generate the necessary serverless functions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database connection to work in Vercel's serverless environment, so that data persistence functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serverless functions execute THEN database connections SHALL be properly managed to avoid connection pool exhaustion
2. WHEN Prisma client is used THEN it SHALL be optimized for serverless cold starts
3. WHEN database migrations are needed THEN they SHALL be handled appropriately for the production environment
4. WHEN the application connects to the database THEN it SHALL use connection pooling suitable for serverless functions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing API routes to work on Vercel, so that the frontend application continues to function without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API routes are accessed THEN they SHALL maintain the same URL structure as the current Express application
2. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL work correctly with the frontend application
3. WHEN middleware is applied THEN it SHALL function properly in the serverless environment
4. WHEN authentication endpoints are called THEN JWT functionality SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging in the Vercel environment, so that I can monitor and debug the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly logged and handled in the serverless environment
2. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL provide appropriate health check endpoints
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN logs SHALL be accessible through Vercel's logging system
4. WHEN rate limiting is applied THEN it SHALL work correctly in the serverless context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and deployment process to be optimized for Vercel, so that deployments are fast and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN it SHALL optimize bundle size for serverless functions
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN only production dependencies SHALL be included in the deployment
3. WHEN TypeScript is compiled THEN the build process SHALL be optimized for Vercel's environment
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the application SHALL start quickly with minimal cold start time
