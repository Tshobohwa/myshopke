# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a complete backend infrastructure to the MyShopKE web application using Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database, implementing authentication and authorization systems. This enhancement will transform the current frontend-only application into a full-stack solution that can persist user data, manage secure access, and provide scalable backend services for farmers and buyers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a farmer or buyer, I want to create an account and securely log in, so that I can access personalized features and my data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL provide separate registration flows for farmers and buyers
2. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL require email, password, full name, phone number, and user type (farmer/buyer)
3. WHEN a farmer registers THEN the system SHALL additionally collect location (county) and farm size information
4. WHEN a user submits registration THEN the system SHALL validate email uniqueness and password strength requirements
5. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and provide a secure session token
6. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their appropriate dashboard based on user type

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a farmer, I want to manage my produce listings with persistent data, so that my listings are saved and buyers can find them reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a farmer creates a produce listing THEN the system SHALL save it to the database with farmer association
2. WHEN a farmer views their listings THEN the system SHALL display only their own produce listings
3. WHEN a farmer edits a listing THEN the system SHALL update the database and maintain listing history
4. WHEN a farmer deletes a listing THEN the system SHALL soft-delete it and preserve data integrity
5. WHEN buyers search listings THEN the system SHALL query the database with proper filtering and pagination

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a buyer, I want to save my preferences and search history, so that I can quickly find relevant produce listings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a buyer applies filters THEN the system SHALL save their search preferences to their profile
2. WHEN a buyer views listings THEN the system SHALL track their viewing history for recommendations
3. WHEN a buyer contacts a farmer THEN the system SHALL log the interaction for both parties
4. WHEN a buyer returns to the app THEN the system SHALL restore their last search filters and preferences
5. WHEN a buyer bookmarks listings THEN the system SHALL save them for quick access later

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want role-based access control, so that users can only access features appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses farmer-specific features THEN the system SHALL verify they have farmer role authorization
2. WHEN a user accesses buyer-specific features THEN the system SHALL verify they have buyer role authorization
3. WHEN an unauthenticated user accesses protected routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for protected actions
5. WHEN a user attempts unauthorized actions THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured API with proper error handling, so that the frontend can reliably interact with backend services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN the system SHALL provide RESTful endpoints with consistent response formats
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback
4. WHEN the API receives invalid data THEN the system SHALL validate inputs and return detailed validation errors
5. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL log requests for monitoring and debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and properly managed, so that my personal information and business data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users provide passwords THEN the system SHALL hash them using secure algorithms before storage
2. WHEN sensitive data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption for all communications
3. WHEN user sessions are created THEN the system SHALL implement secure session management with appropriate timeouts
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
5. WHEN user data is accessed THEN the system SHALL implement proper data access controls and audit logging
