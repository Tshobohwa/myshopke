# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the authentication error handling system to provide users with detailed, actionable error messages when authentication fails. Currently, the system may not display complete error information, making it difficult for users to understand and resolve authentication issues.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user attempting to log in, I want to see detailed error messages when authentication fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display the complete error message from the backend
2. WHEN a network error occurs during authentication THEN the system SHALL display a clear network error message with troubleshooting guidance
3. WHEN the backend returns validation errors THEN the system SHALL display all validation error details in a user-friendly format
4. WHEN authentication fails due to account status issues THEN the system SHALL display specific messages about account deactivation or suspension

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user registering for an account, I want to see comprehensive error messages for registration failures, so that I can correct my input and successfully create an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registration fails due to duplicate email THEN the system SHALL display a clear message indicating the email is already in use
2. WHEN registration fails due to password requirements THEN the system SHALL display all password validation errors
3. WHEN registration fails due to invalid phone number format THEN the system SHALL display specific formatting requirements
4. WHEN registration fails due to server errors THEN the system SHALL display the complete error message with error codes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging authentication issues, I want to see complete error information in the console, so that I can quickly identify and resolve backend integration problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN the system SHALL log complete error objects to the browser console in development mode
2. WHEN API responses contain error details THEN the system SHALL preserve and display all error metadata
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL log request/response details for debugging
4. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed refresh error information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user experiencing authentication issues, I want to see helpful guidance with error messages, so that I can resolve problems independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL include actionable next steps where applicable
2. WHEN showing network errors THEN the system SHALL suggest checking internet connection and server status
3. WHEN displaying validation errors THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific fields that need correction
4. WHEN showing account-related errors THEN the system SHALL provide contact information for support
