# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature modifies the password validation policy in the MyShopKE application to allow users to sign up and change passwords using weak passwords. The current system enforces strong password requirements (8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), but for user convenience and accessibility, we need to relax these requirements to allow simpler passwords.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user registering for an account, I want to be able to use simple passwords, so that I can easily remember my credentials without complex requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with a password of any length THEN the system SHALL accept the password without minimum length validation
2. WHEN a user registers with a password containing only lowercase letters THEN the system SHALL accept the password without requiring uppercase letters
3. WHEN a user registers with a password containing only letters THEN the system SHALL accept the password without requiring numbers
4. WHEN a user registers with a password containing only alphanumeric characters THEN the system SHALL accept the password without requiring special characters
5. WHEN a user registers with a simple password like "password" or "123" THEN the system SHALL allow the registration to proceed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user changing my password, I want to be able to set a simple password, so that I can use credentials that are easy for me to remember.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes their password to a simple password THEN the system SHALL accept the new password without strength validation
2. WHEN a user changes their password to a short password (less than 8 characters) THEN the system SHALL allow the password change
3. WHEN a user changes their password to contain only letters or numbers THEN the system SHALL accept the password change
4. WHEN a user changes their password through the change password endpoint THEN the system SHALL not enforce any password complexity requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the password validation to be completely disabled, so that users can use any password they prefer without system restrictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the password validation function is called THEN the system SHALL always return isValid as true
2. WHEN the password validation function is called THEN the system SHALL return an empty errors array
3. WHEN password validation occurs during registration THEN the system SHALL skip all password strength checks
4. WHEN password validation occurs during password changes THEN the system SHALL skip all password strength checks

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to maintain all other security features while allowing weak passwords, so that my account remains secure through other means.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weak passwords are allowed THEN the system SHALL still hash passwords using bcrypt before storage
2. WHEN weak passwords are allowed THEN the system SHALL still implement proper authentication flows
3. WHEN weak passwords are allowed THEN the system SHALL still protect against SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities
4. WHEN weak passwords are allowed THEN the system SHALL still implement proper session management and JWT tokens
