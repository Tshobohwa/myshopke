# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Modify password validation method to allow weak passwords

  - Update the `validatePasswordStrength` method in `backend/src/utils/auth.ts` to always return `{ isValid: true, errors: [] }`
  - Remove all password complexity checks (length, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
  - Add comment explaining that password validation is disabled to allow weak passwords
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 2. Update unit tests for password validation

  - Modify existing tests for `AuthUtils.validatePasswordStrength()` to expect success for all password inputs
  - Add test cases for various weak passwords (short passwords, simple passwords, numeric-only passwords)
  - Ensure all test cases verify that `isValid` is true and `errors` array is empty
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Test registration flow with weak passwords

  - Create integration tests for user registration using weak passwords
  - Test registration with passwords like "123", "a", "password", "test"
  - Verify that registration completes successfully and passwords are properly hashed
  - Confirm that users can log in with their weak passwords after registration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [x] 4. Test password change flow with weak passwords

  - Create integration tests for password changes using weak passwords
  - Test changing from strong password to weak password
  - Test changing from weak password to another weak password
  - Verify that password changes complete successfully and new passwords work for login
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Verify security measures remain intact

  - Test that passwords are still properly hashed with bcrypt regardless of strength
  - Verify that JWT token generation and validation continue to work correctly
  - Test that authentication flows work normally with weak passwords
  - Confirm that other security features (CORS, rate limiting, input sanitization) remain active
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
